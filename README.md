# WordleScoreBoard

Extremely simple scoreboard I put together for family. 
It was a reasonable success so I figured I'd share it publicly incase anyone else wanted to use it on their own personal server. This is not meant for any wide spread use. 
There is no player validation built in. 
This is really only good for a local group of friends who trust each other.

Uses file system to store data, not a database. So any server with php should be able to handle this with next to no setup.

*This is meant to be on a secret url between yourself and your friends. But you may still wish to __disable PHP execution in the 'grids' folder__*.
